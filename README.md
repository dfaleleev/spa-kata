Getting familiar with different SPA frameworks/libraries

This is a place where I plan to throw my practice on simple projects implemented using different SPA frameworks such as Angular, React and Vue. 

## Goals
- Get more fun and JavaScript practice
- Application should be extremely simple to implement them in reasonable amount of time.
- Using the same application requirements (like Code Kata) should save time on requirements formlulation.
- Get familiar with different SPA environments.
- Compare where one library is better than other.

## Structure
Repository divided by application folders such as (example):
- NotesList - application for note management
- Tasks - everyone should create their own task manager
- BookCatalog

And every application should have folder for technology and then for implementation:

- NotesList
  - README.md - contains explanation of application with requirements.
  - React
     - Notes-ReactJs
     - Notes-ReactTypescript
     - Notes-ReactRedux
  - Angular
     - Notes-Angular

## Applications

### Notes
Simple list of notes, just to make hands dirty.
